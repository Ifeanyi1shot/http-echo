# Containerized Application Deployment Documentation

## Overview
This documentation outlines the process of creating a containerized application using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment on Azure Web Services. The deployment process is optimized for cost-effectiveness and utilizes Azure Pipelines for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

### Prerequisites
1. Terraform
2. Azure DevOps Pipeline
3. Active Azure cloud subscription
4. Docker account with access to the image

## 1. Setting Up Azure Environment
Before starting with Terraform as the IaC provisioner, ensure an Azure subscription and the necessary permissions to create resources. Deploy the application to Azure Web App Service for Container due to its cost-effectiveness, scalability, and managed infrastructure.

## 2. Containerizing the Application
Utilize the existing Dockerfile for containerization. Work directly with the image from the Docker registry.

## 3. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
### Installation
Install Terraform on your local machine.

### Configuration
Create a `main.tf` file with:
- Resource group
- App Service for Container
- Storage account for state file
- App Service plan
- Docker login credentials and Docker image

### Commands
1. `terraform init` - Initialize Terraform in the project directory.
2. `terraform plan` - Review changes in the Terraform file.
3. `terraform apply` - Apply configuration to provision resources on Azure.

## 4. CI/CD with Azure Pipelines
### Setting Up Azure Pipelines
#### Classic Editor
Set up a CI/CD pipeline using the classic editor in Azure DevOps. Configure the pipeline to trigger on the main branch. The pipeline should build, check for code issues, scan for security, and deploy the application using the Terraform file to create the app service.

#### Pipeline YAML Configuration
Alternatively, configure the pipeline using a YAML file for version control, collaboration, and defining pipelines as code. An example YAML file (`echo.yaml`) is provided in the working directory.

**Note:** The pipeline deploys to staging initially. Approval is required to promote the application to production.

## 5. Logging and Metric Platforms
Integrate logging and metric platforms into the application architecture for monitoring and optimization. Utilize Azure Application Insights for comprehensive application performance monitoring, including monitoring, performance tracking, alerts, and usage analytics.

### Other Logging Platforms
Apart from Azure Application Insights, consider other logging platforms available in Azure, such as Azure Monitor, Azure Log Analytics, Azure Sentinel, or third-party logging services.
