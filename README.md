This documentation outlines the steps for deploying a containerized application using Terraform as the Infrastructure as Code (IAC) tool on Azure Web Services. The deployment process prioritizes cost-effectiveness and leverages Azure Pipelines for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

1. Setting Up Azure Environment

Before utilizing Terraform for provisioning, ensure access to an Azure subscription with appropriate permissions. The application will be deployed on Azure Web App Service for Containers due to its cost-effectiveness, scalability, and managed infrastructure.

2. Containerizing the Application

Utilize the existing Dockerfile for containerization, with an option to work directly with the image from the Docker registry. Further explanation on integrating this into the Terraform file will be provided.

3. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

Begin by installing Terraform on your local machine and creating a main.tf file. This file, using the Azurerm provider for Azure cloud, will include:

i. Definition of the Azure resource group
ii. Configuration for the App Service for Containers
iii. Setup for the storage account to store the state file
iv. Configuration for the App Service plan
v. Docker login credentials and Docker image information

After specifying the necessary information in the Terraform file, execute the following commands:

i. terraform init (Initialize Terraform in the project directory)
ii. terraform plan (Review any changes in the Terraform file)
iii. terraform apply (Apply the configuration to provision resources on Azure)

4. CI/CD with Azure Pipelines

Set up a CI/CD pipeline in Azure Pipelines using either:

i. Classic Editor: Utilize the graphical user interface (GUI) to create and configure pipelines without directly manipulating YAML files. The pipeline should trigger on the main branch, conducting code checks, security scans, running the Terraform file to create the App Service, and deploying the application.

ii. YAML Configuration: Employ YAML configuration for defining pipelines as code. An echo.yaml file is provided in the working directory, specifying the triggered branch, variables, steps, and tasks to check code, security, run Terraform, and deploy the application.

Note: The pipeline includes staging and production App Services created by Terraform. Deployment to production requires approval.

5. Logging and Metric Platforms

Integrate Azure Application Insights for monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing application performance. Azure Application Insights provides comprehensive application performance monitoring (APM), enabling real-time monitoring, performance tracking, alerts, usage analytics, and dependency tracking.

Additionally, Azure offers other logging platforms such as Azure Monitor, Azure Log Analytics, Azure Sentinel, and third-party logging services for comprehensive logging and monitoring needs.
